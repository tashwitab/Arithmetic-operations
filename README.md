# Arithmetic-operations
TITLE: Arithmetic operations
AIM: To write a program using arithmetic operators 
THEORY: Arithmetic operators in C++ are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numerical data types. Here are the common arithmetic operators in C++:
        1:Addition +: Adds two operands together.
        2: Subtraction -: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
        3: Multiplication *: Multiplies two operands.
        4: Division /: Divides the left operand by the right operand.
        5: Modulus %: Computes the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
ALGORITHM: 1. Start
           2. Declare two integer variables: num1 and num2.
           3. Initialize num1 with the value 70 and num2 with the value 12.
           4.Display "num1+num2 = " followed by the result of num1 + num2.
           5. Display "num1-num2 = " followed by the result of num1 - num2.
           6. Display "num1*num2 = " followed by the result of num1 * num2.
           7. Display "num1/num2 = " followed by the result of num1 / num2.
           8. Display "num1%num2 = " followed by the result of num1 % num2.
           9.Display "num1%num2 = " followed by the result of num1 % num2.
           10. End
